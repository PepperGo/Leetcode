### 830. Positions of Large Groups
#### 1. List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>();  
The correct way is: List<List<Integer>> list = new ArrayList<List<Integer>>()  
**Reason**:   
Generic type is List<Integer> and we are trying to pass object of subtype i.e. ArrayList<Integer>, so it will not work.

#### 2. Java: String.length  
**Reason**:   
For Java, Here is the syntax of this method âˆ’
```
public int length()
```
For JavaScript, 
```
str.length
```  

size() is a method specified in java.util.Collection, which is then inherited by every data structure in the standard library.  length is a field on any array (arrays are objects, you just don't see the class normally), and length() is a method on java.lang.String, which is just a thin wrapper on a char[] anyway.
