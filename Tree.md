##### Does an balanced binary tree has an unique form?
[Does an balanced binary tree has an unique form?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37608271/does-an-balanced-binary-tree-has-an-unique-form)   
No. There isn't. A balanced tree may have different order based on the order of operations made in order to get to it. Also, there are multiple ways to do a self balancing tree (Red-Black, AVL, Splay) - all result (usually) in different trees.

#### Self-balancing binary search tree
##### Is the AVL tree and balanced binary tree the same thing?
No. An AVL tree is a particular type of balanced binary tree, but there are other kinds as well. The red black tree is the most common.
##### AVL Trees
[Data Structure and Algorithms - AVL Trees](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/avl_tree_algorithm.htm)   
AVL tree checks the height of the left and the right sub-trees and assures that the difference is not more than 1. This difference is called the **Balance Factor**.

- Left rotation
- Right rotation
- Left-Right rotation
- Right-Left rotation   

##### B-tree

##### Red-black tree  


#### 110. Balanced Binary Tree
##### height, size, and depth of a binary tree?
[What is the height, size, and depth of a binary tree?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-height-size-and-depth-of-a-binary-tree)   

An empty tree has height of -1;   
Height of leaf is 0;

### 449. Serialize and Deserialize BST
#### Java, sometimes use array to pass by reference
```  
Everything in Java is pass by value.

If you use an int variable, the function you are passing will only copy its value. 
So that everything changes in this level will not affect other levels.

However, using an int array will pass the copy of its reference to other function/method. 
In this way, any changes to the int array will affect the original array.
```
