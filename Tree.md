##### Does an balanced binary tree has an unique form?
[Does an balanced binary tree has an unique form?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37608271/does-an-balanced-binary-tree-has-an-unique-form)   
No. There isn't. A balanced tree may have different order based on the order of operations made in order to get to it. Also, there are multiple ways to do a self balancing tree (Red-Black, AVL, Splay) - all result (usually) in different trees.

#### Self-balancing binary search tree
##### Is the AVL tree and balanced binary tree the same thing?
No. An AVL tree is a particular type of balanced binary tree, but there are other kinds as well. The red black tree is the most common.
##### AVL Trees
[Data Structure and Algorithms - AVL Trees](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/avl_tree_algorithm.htm)   
AVL tree checks the height of the left and the right sub-trees and assures that the difference is not more than 1. This difference is called the **Balance Factor**.

- Left rotation
- Right rotation
- Left-Right rotation
- Right-Left rotation   

##### B-tree

##### Red-black tree  


#### 110. Balanced Binary Tree
##### height, size, and depth of a binary tree?
[What is the height, size, and depth of a binary tree?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-height-size-and-depth-of-a-binary-tree)   

An empty tree has height of -1;   
Height of leaf is 0;
